Welcome to **BookNest** — a comprehensive library management system designed to simplify the organization and management of books and authors. Whether you're managing a small personal library or a large collection, **BookNest** provides all the essential tools you need.

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**

**BookNest** is a powerful web application built using **ASP.NET Core** and **Entity Framework Core**. It allows users to manage books and authors, perform CRUD operations, search through the collection, and ensure data integrity. The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, promoting a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

## 🎯 **Features**

- **📚 Book Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for books.
- **👤 Author Management**: Manage author information with full CRUD capabilities.
- **🔍 Search Functionality**: Easily search for books and authors in the collection.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: The user interface is built with Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **✅ Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity and consistency with built-in validation.
- **🔒 Security**: Protects user data with authentication and secure handling of sensitive information.

## 🛑 **Prerequisites**

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- 🖥️ [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (with ASP.NET and web development workload)
- ⚙️ [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- 💾 [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

   ```
2. **📂 Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd BookNest
   ```
3. **📦 Restore Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. **🔄 Update Database**
   - Ensure your SQL Server is running.
   - Update the `appsettings.json` with your database connection string.
   - Run the following command to create the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

5. **▶️ Run the Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 📐 **Architecture**

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

- **📝 Model**: Represents the application data (e.g., Books, Authors).
- **🎨 View**: Handles the user interface (HTML, CSS, and Razor views).
- **🔧 Controller**: Manages the interaction between Model and View, processing user input and returning the appropriate response.

## 🗃️ **Database Design**

The database schema was created using **Entity Framework Core's Code-First** approach. The main entities are:

- **📚 Book**: Represents a book in the library.
- **👤 Author**: Represents an author who has written one or more books.

### 🔗 Relationships

- **🔄 One-to-Many Relationship**: An author can write multiple books, but each book is written by one author.

## 🛡️ **Security**

Security is a key consideration in **BookNest**:

- **✔️ Data Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are correctly formatted and prevents invalid data from being saved.
- **🔑 Authentication**: User authentication is managed through **ASP.NET Core Identity**, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- **🛡️ SQL Injection Protection**: All database interactions are handled through **Entity Framework Core**, which automatically protects against SQL injection attacks.

## 📊 **Performance Optimization**

Performance is optimized using:

- **⚡ Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data.
- **🔄 Asynchronous Programming**: Improves application responsiveness by handling multiple requests concurrently.
- **⚙️ Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries using LINQ, with eager loading to minimize the number of database calls.

## 🧪 **Testing**

The application is tested using:

- **🔍 Unit Testing**: Ensures that individual components work as expected.
- **🔗 Integration Testing**: Tests the interaction between different components.
- **👨‍💻 Manual Testing**: Ensures the user interface behaves as expected.

## 🔧 **Deployment**

The application can be deployed on any platform that supports .NET Core. The recommended deployment method is using **Azure App Service** for a cloud-based deployment:

1. **⚙️ Build the Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```
2. **☁️ Deploy to Azure**
   - Use the Azure CLI or Azure Portal to deploy the application.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
